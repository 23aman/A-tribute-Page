            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>Khabib Abdulmanapovich Nurmagomedov was born to an Avar family on 20 September 1988, in the village of
                Sildi
                in the Tsumadinsky District of the Dagestan ASSR, an autonomous republic within the Russian SFSR, Soviet
                Union. He has an older brother, Magomed, and younger sister, Amina. His father's family had moved from
                Sildi
                to Kirovaul, where his father converted the ground floor of their two-storey building into a gym.
                Nurmagomedov grew up in the household with his siblings and cousins. His interest in martial arts began
                when
                watching students training at the gym. Khabib's training as a child included wrestling a bear when he
                was
                nine years old.</p>
            <p>As is common with many children in Dagestan, he began wrestling from an early age: he started at the age
                of
                eight under the tutelage of his father, Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov. A decorated athlete and a veteran of
                the
                Soviet Army, Abdulmanap had also wrestled from an early age, before undergoing training in judo and
                sambo in
                the military. Abdulmanap dedicated his life to coaching the youth in Dagestan, in hopes of offering an
                alternative to the Islamic extremism common to the region.</p>
                <img src="/Images/bg2.png" alt="Error loading image" class="img1">
            <p>In 2001, his family moved to Makhachkala, the capital of Dagestan, where he trained in wrestling from the
                age
                of 12, and judo from 15. He resumed training in combat sambo, under his father, at 17. According to
                Nurmagomedov, the transition from wrestling to judo was difficult, but his father wanted him to get used
                to
                competing in a gi jacket. Abdulmanap was a senior coach for the combat sambo national team in the
                Republic
                of Dagestan, training several athletes in sambo in Makhachkala, Russia. Nurmagomedov frequently got into
                street fights in his youth, before focusing his attention on mixed martial arts. Khabib said that, along
                with his father, three athletes who inspired him were the American boxers Muhammad Ali and Mike Tyson
                and
                the Brazilian footballer Ronaldo.</p>
            <h2>Ultimate Fighting Championship</h2>
            <p>In late 2011, Nurmagomedov signed a six-fight deal to compete in the UFC's lightweight division.

                In his UFC debut, on 20 January 2012 at UFC on FX 1, Nurmagomedov defeated Kamal Shalorus via submission
                in
                the third round.

                Nurmagomedov next defeated Gleison Tibau on 7 July 2012 at UFC 148 via unanimous decision, with all
                three
                judges scoring the fight 30-27.

                Nurmagomedov's next fight was against Thiago Tavares on 19 January 2013 at UFC on FX 7. He won via KO in
                the
                first round. After the fight, Tavares tested positive for Drostanolone, an anabolic steroid, and
                received a
                9-month suspension.

                Nurmagomedov defeated Abel Trujillo on 25 May 2013 at UFC 160 via unanimous decision, with all three
                judges
                scoring the fight 30-27. At the weigh-ins, Nurmagomedov came in over the permitted limit, weighing in at
                158.5 lb. He was given two hours to cut to the lightweight maximum of 156 pounds but elected instead to
                surrender a percentage of his fight purse to Trujillo and the bout was contested at a catchweight. In
                the
                course of the fight, Nurmagomedov set a new UFC record for the most takedowns in a single fight, with 21
                successful takedowns out of 28 attempts.

                In his fifth UFC fight, on 21 September 2013 at UFC 165, Nurmagomedov faced Pat Healy. He dominated the
                fight and won via unanimous decision, with all three judges scoring the fight 30-27. Attending his first
                post-event press conference, UFC president Dana White praised the relative newcomer stating, "That slam,
                when he just scoops him up and slams him, Matt Hughes style. That reminded me of the old Matt Hughes
                where
                he would run a guy across the Octagon and slam him. The kid is exciting. We're probably going to do big
                things with this kid."

                In December, Nurmagomedov challenged Gilbert Melendez on social media, with the two then expected to
                face
                off at UFC 170 on 22 February 2014. However, the bout was cancelled for undisclosed reasons, and
                Melendez
                was replaced by Nate Diaz. However, the match-up was cancelled as Diaz turned the bout down.
                Nurmagomedov
                expressed his disappointment, appearing on The MMA Hour, "If they say that they're willing to fight the
                best, they should fight the best. If they want, I'll take them both at once in the cage."

                Nurmagomedov next faced former UFC Lightweight Champion Rafael dos Anjos on 19 April 2014 at UFC on Fox
                11.
                He dominated the fight and won via unanimous decision, with all three judges scoring the fight 30-27.

                Nurmagomedov was briefly linked to a bout with Donald Cerrone on 27 September 2014 at UFC 178. However,
                the
                pairing was quickly scrapped after it was revealed that Nurmagomedov had suffered a knee injury. He was
                later expected to face Cerrone on 23 May 2015, at UFC 187. However, Nurmagomedov pulled out of the bout
                on
                30 April due to a recurring knee injury and was replaced by John Makdessi.

                Nurmagomedov was expected to face Tony Ferguson on 11 December 2015 at The Ultimate Fighter 22 Finale.
                However, Nurmagomedov pulled out of the fight in late October, citing another injury, and was replaced
                by
                Edson Barboza.</p>
            <h2>Retirement and vacation of the UFC Lightweight Championship</h2>
            <p>Despite attempted negotiations to bring him back for one more fight, UFC president Dana White announced
                on 19
                March 2021 that he had accepted Nurmagomedov's decision to retire and that the UFC Lightweight
                Championship
                had been officially vacated.

                On July 1, 2022 Nurmagomedov was inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame on the International Fight Week in
                Las
                Vegas.</p>
            <h2>MMA promoter</h2>
            <p>Following his retirement, Nurmagomedov purchased the Gorilla Fighting Championship (GFC), a Russian-based
                MMA
                promotion, for $1 million - going on to rename it as the Eagle Fighting Championship (EFC).</p>
            <h2>MMA coach and cornerman</h2>
            <p>Since retiring in October 2020, Nurmagomedov has been an active coach with American Kickboxing Academy
                head
                coach Javier Mendez. He currently coaches and corners current UFC Lightweight Champion Islam Makhachev,
                Zubaira Tukhugov (UFC), Tagir Ulanbekov (UFC), Islam Mamedov (Bellator), Gadzhi Rabadanov (Bellator),
                Saygid
                Izagakhmaev (ONE Championship) and cousins Abubakar Nurmagomedov (UFC), Umar Nurmagomedov (UFC), Usman
                Nurmagomedov (Bellator), and Belal Muhammad at UFC 280.</p>
            <h2>Awards</h2>
            <p>In October 2018, Nurmagomedov was made an "Honorary Citizen of Grozny" by the mayor of Grozny Ibrahim
                Zakriev
                after his victory against McGregor at UFC 229. He was also presented with a Mercedes car by Chechnya's
                head
                Ramzan Kadyrov, funded from the Akhmad Kadyrov Foundation, and his father Abdulmanap was awarded the
                title
                of "Honoured Worker of Physical Culture of the Chechen Republic" by Kadyrov.

                On 5 December, 2019, Head of the Republic of Dagestan Vladimir Vasilyev awarded Nurmagomedov and his
                father,
                Abdulmanap the Order For Services to the Republic of Dagestan for their "significant contributions to
